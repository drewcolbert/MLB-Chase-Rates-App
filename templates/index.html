                <strong>About this WebApp:</strong>
                <br>
                For the duration of the 2024 MLB season, statcast data is being collected for every player on every team. 
                This application allows you to explore the chase rates of every MLB player and team for the 2024 season. 
                The data gets updated everyday so be sure to check back later in the season to see if your team or favorite player made an adjustment.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How is chase rate calculated?</strong>
                <br> 
                Simply put, it is the amount of swings a player has on balls outside of the traditional strike zone divided by the total number of swings by a player. 
                Please note: this does not take into account how far out of the zone a pitch is, it is only based on the x and y coordinate generated from the statcast data. 
                Data is only calculated for players with greater than X swings for the year.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions:</strong>
                <br>
                You can filter by team and view that teams data, and you can further filter by each player on that team that qualifies. To qualify for the leaderboard, a player must have 
                at least 100 swing attempts on the season so far. This number will likely change as the season progresses. By selecting 'View All', you will the data for the entire team. This allows
                you to compare teams as well as players. Once you have decided on who to view, click on "Generate Charts" to view the data for those players. Leaderboards are updated as soon as the data is updated. If you do not see any changes, that means nothing has changed, or you can refresh to regenerate the leaderboard.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How to read the charts:</strong>
                <br>
                The chart contains a pitch location density chart overlayed on top of the density plot of pitches that a player swung at. In other words, the black lines are where a player has seen pitches thrown,
                and the colored areas are the pitches that a player chose to swing at. The red color means that the player swung at the most pitches in that area, the blue areas mean less swings but still enough to be
                considered consistent. Ideally, you want to see a player with a smaller range of pitches they swing at, this shows more disicipline at the plate and will often times lead to a higher batting average.
                You will see the specific data for each player or team in the tables next to the charts.
